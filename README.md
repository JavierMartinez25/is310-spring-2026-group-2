## Group Theme: Gaming as Culture and Data

Our group’s shared thematic focus is **gaming**, understood as a cultural, social, and economic phenomenon rather than just a technical artifact. We are interested in how video games shape player behavior, communities, identity, and meaning, and how these dimensions can be explored through data.

### Scope

#### In Scope
- Video games (PC, console, and mobile)
- Player behavior and engagement
- Gaming communities and fandoms
- Game genres, mechanics, and design patterns
- Esports and competitive gaming
- Representation, identity, and inclusivity in games
- Reviews, ratings, playtime, performance, and social interaction data
- Streaming and content creation around games

#### Out of Scope
- Gambling and casino games
- Hardware benchmarking and system performance
- Purely technical game engine or graphics analysis
- Non-digital tabletop games (unless digitally mediated)
- Game development tutorials or code-focused datasets

## Individual Dataset Ideas

Each group member will develop an individual dataset related to the broader gaming theme. These ideas are preliminary and will be refined over the course of the semester.

### Jesus Vazquez
- **Proposed Dataset:** Esports Earnings Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Dataset Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rankirsh/esports-earnings
- **File Used:** GeneralEsportData.csv

- **Description:**  
  This dataset contains structured information about esports tournaments, including game titles, total prize pools, number of tournaments, number of players, and total earnings distributed. The data spans multiple esports titles and competitive scenes, allowing for comparisons across games and over time.

- **Relation to Group Theme:**  
  Esports represents a major intersection of gaming, competition, labor, and digital culture. This dataset connects directly to the group’s gaming theme by highlighting how different games support professional player ecosystems, how prize money is distributed, and how competitive gaming has evolved as a cultural and economic phenomenon.

- **Why This Topic:**  
  I am interested in how gaming extends beyond play into professionalized spaces such as esports. Prize pools and earnings reflect which games gain institutional support, community investment, and long-term sustainability. Analyzing esports earnings allows me to explore questions about inequality between games, genre popularity, and how cultural attention translates into financial reward within gaming communities.

## Collaboration Plan

### Communication
- Primary communication via Discord or group messaging platform
- In-class work sessions used for planning and check-ins
- Weekly asynchronous updates on progress

### GitHub Organization Strategy
- One shared group repository
- Each team member maintains their own folder for datasets, analysis, and documentation
- Shared files (README, planning documents) stored at the root or in a `planning/` folder
- Use GitHub Issues to track tasks, questions, and milestones
- Pull requests used for major updates to shared files

### Version Control Practices
- Main branch used for stable content
- Clear commit messages describing changes
- Avoid direct edits to others’ folders without coordination

## Notes and Next Steps
- Dataset ideas are exploratory and may change as feasibility and scope become clearer
- Group theme may be refined as individual projects develop
- This document will be updated as the semester progresses
